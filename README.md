# Neural Turing Machines
---
This is a report on the implementation of the paper *[Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401)*. The paper presents the idea of Neural Turing Machines (NTM) and the results of using NTM on a few tasks. However, it does not provide the reader with the neccessary details to reproduce the results presented in the paper. In this report we tried to fill in those gaps and provide an analysis over the experimantals we performed to implement NTM.<br>

There are two files presented here that are titled as follows:

*  Neural Turing Machines: Implementation
*  Neural Turing Machines: Reports and Discussions

We highly suggest skipping the file **Neural Turing Machines: Implementation** on the first read of this report, since this section could be considered as the "behind the scene" section of our report and it is not really needed to understand the results, discussions and analysis presented in the other sections. However, it would be useful to take a look at this section in order to get a feeling about the codes or to be able to reproduce what is done in our report.

* This entire report was done using Google Colaboratory and you can view the ipython notebook for **Neural Turing Machines: Implementation** [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M3QowPFCZvjvGbJGWaUOV-AUxg90KN2g) and for **Neural Turing Machines: Reports and Discussions** [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j4Hg0NhLBOS_OaVUCTgOZOI3y66RilzN/view?usp=sharing)
